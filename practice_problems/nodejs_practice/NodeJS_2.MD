Create a custom Node.js module named `GeometryCalculator`. The module should include functions for the following operations:

1. Volume of Cube 
2. Surface Area of Cube
3. Volume of Cuboid 
4. Surface Area of Cuboid
5. Volume of Sphere 
6. Volume of Cuboid
7. Surface of Cylinder
8. Surface Area of Cylinder
9. Volume of Cone
10. Surface Area of Cone
11. Volume of Pyramid
12. Surface Area of Pyramid
13. Volume of Ellipsoid
14. Surface Area of Ellipsoid

Additionally, create an `index.js` file where you import the `GeometryCalculator` module and demonstrate the usage of each function with example values.
